#Follow these instructions to install CummeRbund:
<https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cummeRbund.html>


#You'll need to go through this separately for 1A and 1B
#First - you need to cd into CuffDiff output directory then do the following:

>R
>library(cummeRbund)
>cuff<-readCufflinks()
>cuff (This will show the cuffset, it will show nothing if it didn't work)

#To filter down to significantly differentially expressed genes:

>sig<-getSig(cuff, alpha=0.05, level='genes')
>sigGenes<-getGenes(cuff,sig)
>sigGenes

#To make the heatmap of differentially expressed genes:

>h<-csHeatmap(sigGenes,cluster='both')
>h
>png(filename = 'thin_heatmap.png', width = 400, height = 1000, units = 'px')
>csHeatmap(sigGenes,cluster='both')
>dev.off()

#To make the dendrogram above the heatmap in 1B:

>den<-csDendro(genes(cuff))
>den
