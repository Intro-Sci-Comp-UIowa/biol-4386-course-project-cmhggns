Bankers, L, Fields, P, McElroy, KE, Boore, JL, Logsdon, JM, Neiman, M. Genomic evidence for population‐specific responses to co‐evolving parasites in a New Zealand freshwater snail.

>Co‐evolving interactions between hosts and parasites create strong selection that can promote rapid, specific evolution.That said, we still only have a limited knowledge of how coevolution
 works in host-parasite relationships on a genomic level. Here, Bankers, et al, analyzes gene expression and sequence mutation to bridge that gap in knowledge between Potamopyrgus antipodarum
 and Microphallus sp., a sterilizing trematode parasite. They found systematic downregulation of many genes in infected P. antipodarum in relation to their uninfected counterparts, but the
 genes experiencing this change in expression differ depending on source location of each snail population, which is consistent with populaiton-level coevolution turning into population-specific
 host-parasite interactions.

*"Heatmaps representing significantly differentially expressed transcripts (higher FPKM = higher expression). Significance was assessed with a
 FDR of 5% and Benjamini‐Hochberg multiple test correction. (a) Inclusive analysis: 1,408 significantly differentially expressed transcripts in
 infected vs. uninfected snails. Transcripts above the black line demarcated with an astricks are downregulated in infected snails (1,057), and
 transcripts below this line are upregulated in infected snails (351). (b) Within‐lake analysis: dendrogram and heatmap representing the 6,228
 significantly differentially expressed transcripts across infection status and lakes. “Ax” = Alexandrina, “Se” = Selfe, “Kn” = Kaniere, red = infected,
 blue = uninfected. Snails clustered by lake of origin rather than infection status, indicating spatially structured gene expression patterns. Highlighted
 regions of heatmap contain examples of: expression differences between infected and uninfected snails within a lake (green), lake‐specific expression
 regardless of infection status (downregulation in Ax, blue) and across‐lake upregulation in infected snails (purple)"(Bankers 2017)*

This figure shows the relative expression levels of many genes across populations from differing origins. There is a clear downregulation
 in expression of certain genes, marked with an astrick, in uninfected snails. While panel (a) shows an all-inclusive analysis, panel
 (b) breaks the analysis down by source lake, highlighting the changes in host-parasite relationship and evolution trajectory. Looking
 at these heat maps leads me to believe they were created in software like [BioVinci](https://vinci.bioturing.com/) or manually in R

# Materials and Methods

*-I don't know for sure what I will need yet. I am in contact with the original authors to figure out what they used. I'll go from there!*
Here's the shasum value for the transcriptome - 741a6a2e0e337034a5a3957b7fc2088d7e39e459  transcriptome

# Results

-Here, I will put a nice figure, similar to the heat map from Bankers, et al 2017. 

# Discussion

-Here, I will talk about that figure.

# Conclusion

-Here, I will talk about what exactly that figure means.
